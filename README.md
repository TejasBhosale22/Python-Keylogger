# Python-Keylogger
- This project is a comprehensive keylogger tool designed primarily for organizations to monitor employee activities and safeguard sensitive company information. The tool captures detailed user activity on a system to prevent data breaches and unauthorized information sharing.
1. Keystroke Logging: Tracks and records all keystrokes entered by the user to identify potential sensitive information leakage.
2. Audio Monitoring: Captures audio inputs through the system's microphone to detect unauthorized discussions.
3. Clipboard Monitoring: Records all clipboard activity, including copied texts, images, and other content.
4. Screenshot Capture: Periodically takes screenshots of the user's desktop for visual evidence of activities.
5. System Information Retrieval: Gathers system-specific details, including active processes, hardware configurations, and network status.
6. Log Transmission: Sends all collected data to a designated monitoring authority for review and analysis.

# Use Case
- The primary purpose of this project is to provide organizations with a robust tool to monitor employee activities and ensure that sensitive information is not compromised. The solution is particularly relevant for businesses handling classified data or working in highly regulated industries.

# Ethical Use
- It is vital to ensure the ethical and legal use of this tool. Organizations must comply with local laws and regulations, inform employees about monitoring policies, and use the system transparently to respect privacy rights while securing sensitive data.
